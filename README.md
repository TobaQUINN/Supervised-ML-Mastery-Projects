# Supervised Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Supervised Machine Learning Mastery Repository**, a curated collection of my projects and experiments using various supervised learning algorithms. This repository serves as a learning log, project portfolio, and reference for regression and classification techniques implemented with real and synthetic datasets.

Projects are categorized by type of task and algorithm:

### ðŸ“‚ Regression
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Trees for Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

### ðŸ“‚ Classification
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees for Classification
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest)

Each project folder contains:
- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script
- Dataset or a link to dataset
- A `README.md` describing the task, approach, results, and improvements

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress
This repository is a work in progress and will be regularly updated with:
- New models
- Performance comparisons
- Visualizations
- Model optimization techniques
